# ToolPay Implementation Notes

This document tracks the implementation progress of the ToolPay MVP, providing overviews of completed chunks and notes for future development. It serves as a companion to the tasks.md file, offering insights into the implementation decisions and outcomes.

## Phase 1: Smart Contracts & Testing

### Chunk 1: Project Setup (COMPLETED)

**Overview**: 
The initial project setup has been completed successfully, establishing the foundational structure for the ToolPay MVP. This chunk focused on creating the necessary directory structure and setting up the CosmWasm contracts that will power the system.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - Created `contracts/` directory for CosmWasm smart contracts
   - Created `packages/` directory for future TypeScript packages
   - Created `frontend/` directory as a placeholder with explanatory README
   - Created `scripts/` directory for helper scripts

2. **CosmWasm Contract Templates**:
   - Generated registry contract using CosmWasm template
   - Generated escrow contract using CosmWasm template
   - Both contracts were initialized with standard CosmWasm structure

3. **Rust Workspace Setup**:
   - Configured Cargo.toml at the project root with proper workspace members
   - Added required dependencies:
     - cosmwasm-std = "1.5"
     - cw-storage-plus = "1.2"
     - schemars
     - serde
     - thiserror
   - Set up optimization settings for Wasm compilation
   - Added rust-toolchain.toml with Rust 1.78 specification

4. **Initial Validation**:
   - Verified that `cargo build` succeeds
   - Added appropriate .gitignore file for Rust and Node artifacts

**Next Steps**:
The project is now ready for Chunk 2, which will focus on implementing the Registry contract according to the specifications in project.md.

### Chunk 2: Registry Contract Implementation (COMPLETED)

**Overview**:
The Registry contract has been fully implemented and tested. All required functionality for registering, updating, pausing, and querying tools has been successfully implemented and verified with a comprehensive test suite.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Contract Logic Implementation**:
   - Implemented `instantiate` function with minimal setup
   - Implemented `execute` function with pattern matching for all message variants
   - Created handlers for all required operations:
     - `RegisterTool`: Validates tool_id length (â‰¤ 16 characters), stores provider address, and saves tool metadata
     - `UpdatePrice`: Verifies sender authorization and updates price
     - `PauseTool`/`ResumeTool`: Manages tool activation state with provider authorization
   - Implemented `query` function for retrieving tool information

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Added proper error types for contract operations
   - Implemented validation checks for unauthorized access
   - Added error handling for non-existent tools

3. **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Created test helpers and mocks to simplify test cases
   - Implemented tests for successful tool registration and validation
   - Added tests for validating tool ID length restrictions
   - Created tests for authorized and unauthorized price updates
   - Added tests for tool pausing and resuming functionality
   - Implemented tests for query functionality with both existing and non-existing tools
   - Refactored tests into a separate module for better organization and maintainability

**Next Steps**:
The Registry contract implementation is now complete. The next phase will focus on implementing the Escrow contract (Chunk 3), beginning with defining its messages and types.

### Chunk 3: Escrow Contract Implementation (IN PROGRESS)

**Overview**:
Work has begun on implementing the Escrow contract. We've completed defining the core message and state types (Task 3.1) and have implemented the `LockFunds` functionality (Task 3.2), which allows users to lock funds for tool usage.

**Current Progress**:

1. **Message Types Implementation** (Task 3.1):
   - Created `msg.rs` with all required message structures:
     - `InstantiateMsg`: Now includes `registry_addr` parameter to connect with the Registry contract
     - `ExecuteMsg`: Implemented with variants for `LockFunds`, `Release`, and `RefundExpired` operations
     - `QueryMsg`: Added with the `GetEscrow` variant for querying escrow details
     - `SudoMsg`: Created with the `Freeze` variant for contract-level admin control
     - `EscrowResponse`: Added response struct for query returns

2. **State Types Implementation** (Task 3.1):
   - Created `state.rs` with core data structures:
     - `Escrow`: Struct with fields for `caller`, `provider`, `max_fee`, `auth_token`, and `expires`
     - `Config`: Struct with `frozen` boolean field and `registry_addr` for Registry contract integration
     - Storage definitions:
       - `ESCROWS`: Map to store escrow data indexed by ID
       - `NEXT_ID`: Item to maintain sequential escrow IDs
       - `CONFIG`: Item to store contract configuration

3. **Registry Interface Implementation** (Task 3.2):
   - Created `registry_interface.rs` for interacting with the Registry contract
   - Implemented `query_tool` function to retrieve tool information
   - Added `ToolResponse` structure matching the Registry contract's response format

4. **LockFunds Implementation** (Task 3.2):
   - Expanded `error.rs` with specific error types for escrow operations:
     - `Frozen` for when the contract is frozen
     - `ToolNotActive` for when tools don't exist or are inactive
     - `InsufficientFunds` for when funds are inadequate
     - `ExpirationTooLong` for when escrow duration exceeds limits
     - Other error types for future functionality
   - Implemented `instantiate` function:
     - Sets contract version for future migrations
     - Validates and stores registry contract address
     - Initializes configuration with `frozen: false` 
     - Sets up escrow ID counter starting at 1
   - Added `execute` function with pattern matching for message types
   - Implemented `lock_funds` handler with all required validations:
     - Queries Registry for tool existence and active status
     - Validates provided funds against maximum fee
     - Ensures expiration is within the 50-block limit (via `MAX_ESCROW_BLOCKS` constant)
     - Creates/stores the escrow and increments the ID counter
     - Emits `wasm-toolpay.locked` event with relevant attributes
     - Returns escrow ID to caller

5. **Release Implementation** (Task 3.3):
   - Implemented `release` handler function:
     - Loads and validates escrow existence by ID
     - Verifies that only the original provider can release funds
     - Ensures the escrow hasn't expired before attempting release
     - Validates that the usage fee doesn't exceed the maximum fee
     - Implements fund transfers for both provider payment and refunds:
       - Sends the usage fee to the provider
       - Returns any remaining funds to the original caller
     - Performs cleanup by removing the escrow from storage
     - Emits `wasm-toolpay.released` event with detailed attributes:
       - escrow_id, provider, caller, usage_fee, refund_amount
   - Fixed warnings and optimized imports in contract.rs

6. **RefundExpired Implementation** (Task 3.4):
   - Implemented `refund_expired` handler function:
     - Loads and validates escrow existence by ID
     - Verifies that only the original caller (not provider) can request refunds
     - Validates that the escrow has actually expired (current block > expires)
     - Creates a bank message to return all locked funds to the original caller
     - Performs cleanup by removing the escrow from storage
     - Emits `wasm-toolpay.refunded` event with relevant attributes:
       - escrow_id, caller, refund_amount

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Registry Contract Integration**: The Escrow contract now requires a Registry contract address during instantiation, establishing a clear dependency between the contracts
2. **Frozen State Check**: All execute operations first check if the contract is frozen, providing a global way to halt operations if needed
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types were added for detailed failure reporting
4. **Expiration Limits**: Set a maximum of 50 blocks for escrow expiration to prevent funds being locked for too long
5. **Event Emissions**: Standard events are emitted for blockchain explorers and indexers
6. **Fund Transfer Logic**: Implemented conditional fund transfers that only execute when amounts are non-zero
7. **Partial Release Support**: Added support for providers to claim only part of the maximum fee, automatically refunding the remainder
8. **Security Controls**: Strict verification of caller identity in all operations, ensuring only authorized parties can perform actions

7. **Query and Sudo Implementation** (Task 3.5):
   - Implemented `query` function for handling `GetEscrow` requests:
     - Added a helper function `query_escrow` that retrieves escrow details by ID
     - Returns properly formatted `EscrowResponse` with all escrow details
     - Handles error cases when escrows don't exist
     - Uses modern `to_json_binary` function instead of deprecated alternatives
   - Implemented `sudo` function for handling admin commands:
     - Added support for the `Freeze` command that can freeze the contract
     - Loads current configuration, sets frozen state, and saves it back
     - Prevents any further execute operations when frozen
     - Returns appropriate response with action attributes

**Next Steps**:
With the core contract functionality now fully implemented (Tasks 3.1-3.5), the next phase will focus on implementing comprehensive unit tests for the contracts (Chunk 4).

### Chunk 4: Contract Unit Tests (IN PROGRESS)

**Overview**:
Work has begun on implementing comprehensive unit tests for both the Registry and Escrow contracts. The initial focus is on setting up a robust testing environment with cw-multi-test that allows for proper integration testing between contracts.

**Current Progress**:

1. **Testing Environment Setup** (Task 4.1):
   - Created a well-organized test directory structure for the Escrow contract:
     - Added `tests/mod.rs` as the main entry point for all test modules
     - Set up importing structure for different test categories (lock_funds, release, refund, etc.)
   - Configured `cw-multi-test` framework for integration testing:
     - Implemented `mock_app()` function that creates a test blockchain with initial balances
     - Set up contract code storage and instantiation helpers
     - Added support for bank operations to test fund transfers
   - Created mock accounts for different roles in the system:
     - `OWNER`: Contract deployer and admin
     - `PROVIDER`: Tool provider account
     - `USER`: Regular user that locks funds for tool usage
     - `UNAUTHORIZED`: Account without proper permissions for testing edge cases
   - Implemented helper functions for common contract operations:
     - `setup_contracts()`: Instantiates both Registry and Escrow contracts
     - `register_tool()`: Registers a tool in the Registry contract
     - `lock_funds()`: Locks funds in the Escrow contract
     - `release_funds()`: Releases funds to the provider
     - `refund_expired()`: Refunds an expired escrow
     - `query_escrow()`: Gets escrow details by ID
   - Set up integration between Registry and Escrow contracts:
     - Configured Registry contract address to be passed to Escrow contract
     - Enabled cross-contract querying for tool validation
     - Created `TestContracts` struct to manage both contracts in tests
   - Created initial test for locking funds:
     - Implemented `test_lock_funds_success` to validate basic escrow creation
     - Verified proper fund transfers between accounts
     - Validated escrow data is stored correctly

2. **Happy Path Tests Implementation** (Task 4.2):
   - Created comprehensive end-to-end integration tests:
     - Implemented `complete_flow_test.rs` to validate the full escrow lifecycle:
       - Tool registration by provider
       - Fund locking by user
       - Fund release by provider
       - Verification of final balances for both parties
     - Added `partial_fee_test.rs` to test refund functionality:
       - Verifies provider can charge less than maximum fee
       - Validates proper refunding of unused funds to the user
       - Ensures exact balance calculations for partial fee usage
     - Implemented `query_test.rs` for testing query functionality:
       - Verifies escrow data can be properly retrieved
       - Validates all escrow fields match expected values
       - Tests proper response formatting
     - Implemented `registry_basic_test.rs` to verify Registry contract functionality:
       - Tests basic tool registration, querying, and management
       - Verifies tool activation/deactivation (pause/resume)
       - Confirms price updates work correctly
       - Ensures proper authorization checks for all operations

3. **Edge Case Tests Implementation** (Task 4.3):
   - Implemented comprehensive error and edge case testing:
     - Created `exceed_max_ttl_test.rs` to validate TTL constraints:
       - Verifies contract rejects escrows with expiration > 50 blocks
       - Tests exact error messages and parameters for TTL violations
     - Added `excessive_fee_test.rs` to test fee limits:
       - Ensures providers cannot charge more than the maximum fee
       - Verifies proper error handling with detailed fee information
     - Implemented `unauthorized_release_test.rs` for authorization checks:
       - Tests that only the original provider can release funds
       - Confirms unauthorized users and even the escrow creator cannot release
     - Created `expired_escrow_refund_test.rs` for timeout handling:
       - Tests complete refund flow for expired escrows
       - Verifies funds are fully returned to the original caller
       - Confirms escrow state is properly cleaned up after refund
     - Added `non_expired_refund_test.rs` for premature refund attempts:
       - Ensures escrows cannot be refunded before expiration
       - Verifies proper error responses for premature refund attempts
     - Implemented `frozen_contract_test.rs` for administrative controls:
       - Tests contract behavior when frozen by admin via sudo
       - Verifies all operations (lock, release, refund) are rejected when frozen
       - Confirms proper error messages for frozen contract interactions

**Test Execution Issues** (Task 4.4):
Initial test execution revealed several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Registry Import Issues**: The escrow tests are not correctly importing the registry crate. This is causing compilation errors as the tests are trying to use registry modules without proper imports. âœ… FIXED

2. **Type Conversion Problems**: There are issues with converting between data types, specifically:
   - Converting `Vec<u8>` to `String` for auth_token âœ… FIXED
   - Comparing `Addr` objects with `&str` values in assertions âœ… FIXED

3. **Field Name Mismatches**: The tests are using incorrect field names in some message variants:
   - Using `id` instead of `escrow_id` in `QueryMsg::GetEscrow` âœ… FIXED

4. **Sudo Implementation Issues**: The sudo implementation in the tests is incorrect:
   - Passing both contract address and message to the sudo function when it only accepts a message âœ… FIXED

The auth_token type conversion issue has been fixed. After thorough examination of the codebase, I confirmed that the `auth_token` field is consistently defined as a `String` in the Escrow contract's structures (in both `state.rs` and `msg.rs`). The test helper function `lock_funds` in `setup_contract.rs` was already correctly converting the `Vec<u8>` to `String` using `String::from_utf8(auth_token)?`. In the `lock_funds_tests.rs` file, the auth_token was also being properly converted to a String before comparison with `let auth_token_str = String::from_utf8(auth_token).unwrap();`. This ensures consistent handling of the auth_token between test code and contract code.

**Code Improvement**: To further enhance consistency and simplicity, the auth_token handling was standardized to use String directly throughout the codebase. The `lock_funds` helper function was updated to accept a String parameter instead of Vec<u8>, and all test files now create auth_tokens as Strings directly rather than creating byte vectors and converting them. This eliminates unnecessary conversions, improves code clarity, and reduces potential points of failure.

To complete this standardization, a manual search and replace was performed on all test files to replace instances of `".as_bytes().to_vec()"` with `".to_string()"`. This ensures that auth_token is created as String directly in all test files, maintaining type consistency throughout the codebase and eliminating the need for any Vec<u8> to String conversions.

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Modular Test Structure**: Each test functionality is separated into its own module for better organization
2. **Integration Testing Focus**: Using cw-multi-test to test real cross-contract interactions rather than just mocking
3. **Helper Functions**: Created comprehensive helpers to reduce code duplication in tests
4. **Predefined Constants**: Using test constants for common values to ensure consistency across tests
5. **Full End-to-End Testing**: Setting up infrastructure to test complete flows rather than isolated functions

**Next Steps**:
With the testing environment now configured, the next task is to implement comprehensive happy path tests (Task 4.2) that verify the core functionality flows correctly from start to finish.

## Architecture Notes

From the project specification (project.md), the ToolPay MVP implements a pay-per-call workflow for AI tools with the following key components:

1. **Registry Contract**: Manages tool registration and metadata
   - Providers register tools with pricing
   - Tools can be paused/resumed
   - Query interface for tool discovery

2. **Escrow Contract**: Handles fund locking and release
   - Users lock funds for tool usage
   - Providers verify usage and claim fees
   - Timeout mechanism for refunds

3. **Provider SDK**: Typescript library for tool providers
   - Verification of escrows
   - Usage reporting and fee claiming

The implementation follows a phased approach as outlined in blueprint.md, focusing first on contract development, then SDK development, and finally frontend components if required.
