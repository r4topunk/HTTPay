# ToolPay Implementation Notes

This document tracks the implementation progress of the ToolPay MVP, providing overviews of completed chunks and notes for future development. It serves as a companion to the tasks.md file, offering insights into the implementation decisions and outcomes.

## Phase 1: Smart Contracts & Testing

### Chunk 1: Project Setup (COMPLETED)

**Overview**: 
The initial project setup has been completed successfully, establishing the foundational structure for the ToolPay MVP. This chunk focused on creating the necessary directory structure and setting up the CosmWasm contracts that will power the system.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - Created `contracts/` directory for CosmWasm smart contracts
   - Created `packages/` directory for future TypeScript packages
   - Created `frontend/` directory as a placeholder with explanatory README
   - Created `scripts/` directory for helper scripts

2. **CosmWasm Contract Templates**:
   - Generated registry contract using CosmWasm template
   - Generated escrow contract using CosmWasm template
   - Both contracts were initialized with standard CosmWasm structure

3. **Rust Workspace Setup**:
   - Configured Cargo.toml at the project root with proper workspace members
   - Added required dependencies:
     - cosmwasm-std = "1.5"
     - cw-storage-plus = "1.2"
     - schemars
     - serde
     - thiserror
   - Set up optimization settings for Wasm compilation
   - Added rust-toolchain.toml with Rust 1.78 specification

4. **Initial Validation**:
   - Verified that `cargo build` succeeds
   - Added appropriate .gitignore file for Rust and Node artifacts

**Next Steps**:
The project is now ready for Chunk 2, which will focus on implementing the Registry contract according to the specifications in project.md.

### Chunk 2: Registry Contract Implementation (COMPLETED)

**Overview**:
The Registry contract has been fully implemented and tested. All required functionality for registering, updating, pausing, and querying tools has been successfully implemented and verified with a comprehensive test suite.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Contract Logic Implementation**:
   - Implemented `instantiate` function with minimal setup
   - Implemented `execute` function with pattern matching for all message variants
   - Created handlers for all required operations:
     - `RegisterTool`: Validates tool_id length (â‰¤ 16 characters), stores provider address, and saves tool metadata
     - `UpdatePrice`: Verifies sender authorization and updates price
     - `PauseTool`/`ResumeTool`: Manages tool activation state with provider authorization
   - Implemented `query` function for retrieving tool information

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Added proper error types for contract operations
   - Implemented validation checks for unauthorized access
   - Added error handling for non-existent tools

3. **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Created test helpers and mocks to simplify test cases
   - Implemented tests for successful tool registration and validation
   - Added tests for validating tool ID length restrictions
   - Created tests for authorized and unauthorized price updates
   - Added tests for tool pausing and resuming functionality
   - Implemented tests for query functionality with both existing and non-existing tools
   - Refactored tests into a separate module for better organization and maintainability

**Next Steps**:
The Registry contract implementation is now complete. The next phase will focus on implementing the Escrow contract (Chunk 3), beginning with defining its messages and types.

### Chunk 3: Escrow Contract Implementation (IN PROGRESS)

**Overview**:
Work has begun on implementing the Escrow contract, starting with defining the core message and state types required for the contract's functionality.

**Current Progress**:

1. **Message Types Implementation**:
   - Created `msg.rs` with all required message structures:
     - `InstantiateMsg`: Empty struct for MVP as specified
     - `ExecuteMsg`: Implemented with variants for `LockFunds`, `Release`, and `RefundExpired` operations
     - `QueryMsg`: Added with the `GetEscrow` variant for querying escrow details
     - `SudoMsg`: Created with the `Freeze` variant for contract-level admin control
     - `EscrowResponse`: Added response struct for query returns

2. **State Types Implementation**:
   - Created `state.rs` with core data structures:
     - `Escrow`: Struct with fields for `caller`, `provider`, `max_fee`, `auth_token`, and `expires`
     - `Config`: Struct with `frozen` boolean field for contract-level control
     - Storage definitions:
       - `ESCROWS`: Map to store escrow data indexed by ID
       - `NEXT_ID`: Item to maintain sequential escrow IDs
       - `CONFIG`: Item to store contract configuration

**Next Steps**:
Continue with Task 3.2 to implement the `LockFunds` functionality, which will require integration with the Registry contract.

## Architecture Notes

From the project specification (project.md), the ToolPay MVP implements a pay-per-call workflow for AI tools with the following key components:

1. **Registry Contract**: Manages tool registration and metadata
   - Providers register tools with pricing
   - Tools can be paused/resumed
   - Query interface for tool discovery

2. **Escrow Contract**: Handles fund locking and release
   - Users lock funds for tool usage
   - Providers verify usage and claim fees
   - Timeout mechanism for refunds

3. **Provider SDK**: Typescript library for tool providers
   - Verification of escrows
   - Usage reporting and fee claiming

The implementation follows a phased approach as outlined in blueprint.md, focusing first on contract development, then SDK development, and finally frontend components if required.
