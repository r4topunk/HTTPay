# ToolPay Implementation Notes

This document tracks the implementation progress of the ToolPay MVP, providing overviews of completed chunks and notes for future development. It serves as a companion to the tasks.md file, offering insights into the implementation decisions and outcomes.

## Phase 1: Smart Contracts & Testing

### Chunk 1: Project Setup (COMPLETED)

**Overview**: 
The initial project setup has been completed successfully, establishing the foundational structure for the ToolPay MVP. This chunk focused on creating the necessary directory structure and setting up the CosmWasm contracts that will power the system.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - Created `contracts/` directory for CosmWasm smart contracts
   - Created `packages/` directory for future TypeScript packages
   - Created `frontend/` directory as a placeholder with explanatory README
   - Created `scripts/` directory for helper scripts

2. **CosmWasm Contract Templates**:
   - Generated registry contract using CosmWasm template
   - Generated escrow contract using CosmWasm template
   - Both contracts were initialized with standard CosmWasm structure

3. **Rust Workspace Setup**:
   - Configured Cargo.toml at the project root with proper workspace members
   - Added required dependencies:
     - cosmwasm-std = "1.5"
     - cw-storage-plus = "1.2"
     - schemars
     - serde
     - thiserror
   - Set up optimization settings for Wasm compilation
   - Added rust-toolchain.toml with Rust 1.78 specification

4. **Initial Validation**:
   - Verified that `cargo build` succeeds
   - Added appropriate .gitignore file for Rust and Node artifacts

**Next Steps**:
The project is now ready for Chunk 2, which will focus on implementing the Registry contract according to the specifications in project.md.

### Chunk 2: Registry Contract Implementation (COMPLETED)

**Overview**:
The Registry contract has been fully implemented and tested. All required functionality for registering, updating, pausing, and querying tools has been successfully implemented and verified with a comprehensive test suite.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Contract Logic Implementation**:
   - Implemented `instantiate` function with minimal setup
   - Implemented `execute` function with pattern matching for all message variants
   - Created handlers for all required operations:
     - `RegisterTool`: Validates tool_id length (â‰¤ 16 characters), stores provider address, and saves tool metadata
     - `UpdatePrice`: Verifies sender authorization and updates price
     - `PauseTool`/`ResumeTool`: Manages tool activation state with provider authorization
   - Implemented `query` function for retrieving tool information

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Added proper error types for contract operations
   - Implemented validation checks for unauthorized access
   - Added error handling for non-existent tools

3. **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Created test helpers and mocks to simplify test cases
   - Implemented tests for successful tool registration and validation
   - Added tests for validating tool ID length restrictions
   - Created tests for authorized and unauthorized price updates
   - Added tests for tool pausing and resuming functionality
   - Implemented tests for query functionality with both existing and non-existing tools
   - Refactored tests into a separate module for better organization and maintainability

**Next Steps**:
The Registry contract implementation is now complete. The next phase will focus on implementing the Escrow contract (Chunk 3), beginning with defining its messages and types.

### Chunk 3: Escrow Contract Implementation (IN PROGRESS)

**Overview**:
Work has begun on implementing the Escrow contract. We've completed defining the core message and state types (Task 3.1) and have implemented the `LockFunds` functionality (Task 3.2), which allows users to lock funds for tool usage.

**Current Progress**:

1. **Message Types Implementation** (Task 3.1):
   - Created `msg.rs` with all required message structures:
     - `InstantiateMsg`: Now includes `registry_addr` parameter to connect with the Registry contract
     - `ExecuteMsg`: Implemented with variants for `LockFunds`, `Release`, and `RefundExpired` operations
     - `QueryMsg`: Added with the `GetEscrow` variant for querying escrow details
     - `SudoMsg`: Created with the `Freeze` variant for contract-level admin control
     - `EscrowResponse`: Added response struct for query returns

2. **State Types Implementation** (Task 3.1):
   - Created `state.rs` with core data structures:
     - `Escrow`: Struct with fields for `caller`, `provider`, `max_fee`, `auth_token`, and `expires`
     - `Config`: Struct with `frozen` boolean field and `registry_addr` for Registry contract integration
     - Storage definitions:
       - `ESCROWS`: Map to store escrow data indexed by ID
       - `NEXT_ID`: Item to maintain sequential escrow IDs
       - `CONFIG`: Item to store contract configuration

3. **Registry Interface Implementation** (Task 3.2):
   - Created `registry_interface.rs` for interacting with the Registry contract
   - Implemented `query_tool` function to retrieve tool information
   - Added `ToolResponse` structure matching the Registry contract's response format

4. **LockFunds Implementation** (Task 3.2):
   - Expanded `error.rs` with specific error types for escrow operations:
     - `Frozen` for when the contract is frozen
     - `ToolNotActive` for when tools don't exist or are inactive
     - `InsufficientFunds` for when funds are inadequate
     - `ExpirationTooLong` for when escrow duration exceeds limits
     - Other error types for future functionality
   - Implemented `instantiate` function:
     - Sets contract version for future migrations
     - Validates and stores registry contract address
     - Initializes configuration with `frozen: false` 
     - Sets up escrow ID counter starting at 1
   - Added `execute` function with pattern matching for message types
   - Implemented `lock_funds` handler with all required validations:
     - Queries Registry for tool existence and active status
     - Validates provided funds against maximum fee
     - Ensures expiration is within the 50-block limit (via `MAX_ESCROW_BLOCKS` constant)
     - Creates/stores the escrow and increments the ID counter
     - Emits `wasm-toolpay.locked` event with relevant attributes
     - Returns escrow ID to caller

5. **Release Implementation** (Task 3.3):
   - Implemented `release` handler function:
     - Loads and validates escrow existence by ID
     - Verifies that only the original provider can release funds
     - Ensures the escrow hasn't expired before attempting release
     - Validates that the usage fee doesn't exceed the maximum fee
     - Implements fund transfers for both provider payment and refunds:
       - Sends the usage fee to the provider
       - Returns any remaining funds to the original caller
     - Performs cleanup by removing the escrow from storage
     - Emits `wasm-toolpay.released` event with detailed attributes:
       - escrow_id, provider, caller, usage_fee, refund_amount
   - Fixed warnings and optimized imports in contract.rs

6. **RefundExpired Implementation** (Task 3.4):
   - Implemented `refund_expired` handler function:
     - Loads and validates escrow existence by ID
     - Verifies that only the original caller (not provider) can request refunds
     - Validates that the escrow has actually expired (current block > expires)
     - Creates a bank message to return all locked funds to the original caller
     - Performs cleanup by removing the escrow from storage
     - Emits `wasm-toolpay.refunded` event with relevant attributes:
       - escrow_id, caller, refund_amount

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Registry Contract Integration**: The Escrow contract now requires a Registry contract address during instantiation, establishing a clear dependency between the contracts
2. **Frozen State Check**: All execute operations first check if the contract is frozen, providing a global way to halt operations if needed
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types were added for detailed failure reporting
4. **Expiration Limits**: Set a maximum of 50 blocks for escrow expiration to prevent funds being locked for too long
5. **Event Emissions**: Standard events are emitted for blockchain explorers and indexers
6. **Fund Transfer Logic**: Implemented conditional fund transfers that only execute when amounts are non-zero
7. **Partial Release Support**: Added support for providers to claim only part of the maximum fee, automatically refunding the remainder
8. **Security Controls**: Strict verification of caller identity in all operations, ensuring only authorized parties can perform actions

**Next Steps**:
Continue with Task 3.5 to implement the query and sudo functionality, including the `GetEscrow` query and `Freeze` sudo command.

## Architecture Notes

From the project specification (project.md), the ToolPay MVP implements a pay-per-call workflow for AI tools with the following key components:

1. **Registry Contract**: Manages tool registration and metadata
   - Providers register tools with pricing
   - Tools can be paused/resumed
   - Query interface for tool discovery

2. **Escrow Contract**: Handles fund locking and release
   - Users lock funds for tool usage
   - Providers verify usage and claim fees
   - Timeout mechanism for refunds

3. **Provider SDK**: Typescript library for tool providers
   - Verification of escrows
   - Usage reporting and fee claiming

The implementation follows a phased approach as outlined in blueprint.md, focusing first on contract development, then SDK development, and finally frontend components if required.
