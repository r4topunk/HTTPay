# ToolPay Implementation Notes

This document tracks the implementation progress of the ToolPay MVP, providing overviews of completed chunks and notes for future development. It serves as a companion to the tasks.md file, offering insights into the implementation decisions and outcomes.

## Phase 1: Smart Contracts & Testing

### Chunk 1: Project Setup (COMPLETED)

**Overview**: 
The initial project setup has been completed successfully, establishing the foundational structure for the ToolPay MVP. This chunk focused on creating the necessary directory structure and setting up the CosmWasm contracts that will power the system.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - Created `contracts/` directory for CosmWasm smart contracts
   - Created `packages/` directory for future TypeScript packages
   - Created `frontend/` directory as a placeholder with explanatory README
   - Created `scripts/` directory for helper scripts

2. **CosmWasm Contract Templates**:
   - Generated registry contract using CosmWasm template
   - Generated escrow contract using CosmWasm template
   - Both contracts were initialized with standard CosmWasm structure

3. **Rust Workspace Setup**:
   - Configured Cargo.toml at the project root with proper workspace members
   - Added required dependencies:
     - cosmwasm-std = "1.5"
     - cw-storage-plus = "1.2"
     - schemars
     - serde
     - thiserror
   - Set up optimization settings for Wasm compilation
   - Added rust-toolchain.toml with Rust 1.78 specification

4. **Initial Validation**:
   - Verified that `cargo build` succeeds
   - Added appropriate .gitignore file for Rust and Node artifacts

**Next Steps**:
The project is now ready for Chunk 2, which will focus on implementing the Registry contract according to the specifications in project.md.

## Architecture Notes

From the project specification (project.md), the ToolPay MVP implements a pay-per-call workflow for AI tools with the following key components:

1. **Registry Contract**: Manages tool registration and metadata
   - Providers register tools with pricing
   - Tools can be paused/resumed
   - Query interface for tool discovery

2. **Escrow Contract**: Handles fund locking and release
   - Users lock funds for tool usage
   - Providers verify usage and claim fees
   - Timeout mechanism for refunds

3. **Provider SDK**: Typescript library for tool providers
   - Verification of escrows
   - Usage reporting and fee claiming

The implementation follows a phased approach as outlined in blueprint.md, focusing first on contract development, then SDK development, and finally frontend components if required.
