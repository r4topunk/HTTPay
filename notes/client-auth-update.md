# Client Authentication Update

## Overview
This update focused on improving the security and consistency of the AI-Wallet Client Demo by modifying the client authentication mechanism to use private keys instead of mnemonics. The goal was to align the client authentication method with the provider authentication and enhance overall security.

## Changes Made

### Client Authentication
- Updated the demo script (`aiWalletDemo.ts`) to use private key authentication for the client instead of mnemonic-based authentication.
- Modified the environment variable documentation to clarify that `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY` now expects a private key.
- Updated variable names throughout the code to reflect the new authentication approach:
  - Renamed `clientMnemonic` to `clientPrivateKey`
  - Updated error messages for clarity
- Changed the client wallet creation method from `createWalletFromMnemonic()` to `createWalletFromPrivateKey()`
- Updated the SDK connection method from `connectWithMnemonic()` to `connectWithPrivateKey()`
- Added clarity to console output, specifically noting when addresses are derived from private keys

### Benefits of This Change
- **Improved Security**: Private keys are more secure in certain contexts compared to mnemonics
- **Consistency**: Both client and provider now use the same authentication mechanism
- **Simplified Integration**: Makes integration with external systems more straightforward
- **Code Clarity**: Variable names and documentation now accurately reflect the authentication method

## Next Steps
- The demo script still requires a simple HTTP server implementation for the provider side
- Further enhancements to security practices around key management could be implemented
- Additional validation could be added to ensure private keys meet security requirements
