# Adding Mandatory Description Field to Registry Contract

## Overview

The Pay-Per-Tool registry contract has been enhanced by adding a mandatory description field to the tool metadata. This field allows providers to include a description of their tool that can be helpful for users browsing the registry. The description has a maximum length of 256 characters.

## Changes Made

1. **State Updates**:
   - Added a `description: String` field to the `ToolMeta` struct in `state.rs`

2. **Message Updates**:
   - Added `description: String` parameter to `ExecuteMsg::RegisterTool` in `msg.rs`
   - Added `description: String` field to `ToolResponse` struct in `msg.rs`

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added a new error variant `DescriptionTooLong` to `ContractError` for validation

4. **Contract Logic**:
   - Updated `execute_register_tool` handler to:
     - Accept and validate the description parameter (â‰¤ 256 characters)
     - Store the description in the tool metadata
     - Include the description in the response attributes
   - Updated `query_tool` function to include description in responses

5. **Tests**:
   - Updated all existing test cases to include description parameter
   - Added a new test case `register_tool_invalid_description.rs` to verify description length validation

6. **SDK Updates**:
   - Updated the TypeScript `RegistryExecuteMsg` type to include description
   - Updated the `ToolResponse` interface to include the description field
   - Modified the `registerTool` method in `RegistryClient` class to include description parameter
   - Updated `registry_interface.rs` in the escrow contract to include description field in `ToolResponse`

## Validation

The changes have been fully tested with both positive and negative cases:

1. **Successful Registration**: Verified that a tool can be registered with a valid description
2. **Description Validation**: Confirmed that attempting to register a tool with a description > 256 characters fails with the appropriate error
3. **Query Functionality**: Verified that the description field is correctly included in query responses

## Integration Notes

For frontend and client applications interacting with the Registry contract, the description field is now mandatory when registering tools. Existing tools without a description field will need to be migrated if the contract is upgraded.
