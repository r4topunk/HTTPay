import { PayPerToolSDK } from '@toolpay/provider-sdk';

// SDK initialization
const sdk = new PayPerToolSDK({
  rpcEndpoint: 'https://rpc-palvus.pion-1.ntrn.tech',
  registryAddress: contractAddresses.registry,
  escrowAddress: contractAddresses.escrow,
  chainId: 'pion-1'
});
```

## Key Features Validated

### 1. Wallet Connection
```typescript
// Mnemonic-based wallet connection
const connectWallet = async (mnemonic: string) => {
  await sdk.connectWallet({ mnemonic });
  // Updates UI with wallet info
};
```

### 2. Tool Registration
```typescript
// Register new tool with validation
const registerTool = async (toolId: string, price: string, description: string) => {
  const result = await sdk.registry.registerTool(toolId, price, description);
  // Handles success/error states
};
```

### 3. Escrow Management
```typescript
// Create escrow with customizable parameters
const lockFunds = async (toolId: string, maxFee: string, authToken: string, ttl: string) => {
  const escrowId = await sdk.escrow.lockFunds(toolId, maxFee, authToken, Number(ttl));
  // Returns escrow ID for tracking
};
```

### 4. Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages:
- Network connectivity issues
- Contract interaction errors
- Validation errors
- Wallet connection problems

## User Interface Features

### Layout

- All SDK methods work as expected
- Error handling is robust
- The UI provides good developer experience
- The integration pattern is clear for other developers

This debug page can serve as the foundation for building production user interfaces that integrate with the HTTPay system.

## ✅ Frontend Debug Page - Fully Completed & Debugged

The frontend debug page has been successfully implemented, validated, and all critical issues resolved:

### Recent Component Refactoring (Latest Update) ✅

**Major Achievement**: Successfully refactored the large 938-line debug page component into a well-structured, maintainable component architecture following React best practices.

#### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
- **Extracted State Management**: Created `SDKContext` using React Context API to centrally manage all state and business logic
- **Component Decomposition**: Split monolithic component into 9 focused, single-responsibility components:
  - `SDKConfiguration`: Handles SDK connection settings
  - `WalletConnection`: Manages wallet connection UI
  - `ToolRegistration`: Form for registering new tools
  - `ToolsList`: Displays available tools
  - `EscrowCreation`: Form for creating escrows
  - `EscrowsList`: Displays created escrows
  - `EscrowVerification`: Form for verifying escrows
  - `UsagePosting`: Form for posting tool usage

#### 📁 New File Structure
```
packages/httpay-website/components/demo/
├── types.ts                    # TypeScript interfaces and types
├── sdk-context.tsx            # React Context provider for state management
├── index.ts                   # Clean component exports
├── sdk-configuration.tsx      # SDK connection settings
├── wallet-connection.tsx      # Wallet management UI
├── tool-registration.tsx      # Tool registration form
├── tools-list.tsx            # Available tools display
├── escrow-creation.tsx        # Escrow creation form
├── escrows-list.tsx          # Created escrows display
├── escrow-verification.tsx    # Escrow verification form
└── usage-posting.tsx         # Usage reporting form
```

#### 🎯 Key Benefits Achieved
1. **Separation of Concerns**: UI components now consume context data instead of managing state directly
2. **Reusability**: Components can be easily reused in other parts of the application
3. **Testability**: Smaller, focused components are much easier to unit test
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to one feature don't affect others
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
6. **Performance**: Used `useCallback` in context for optimal performance

#### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details
- **Context Provider Pattern**: All business logic and state management extracted into `SDKContext`
- **Custom Hook**: `useSDK()` hook provides clean API for components to access context
- **Form State Management**: Each form component manages its own local state
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling through context with toast notifications
- **Loading States**: Proper loading state management for all async operations

#### ✅ Quality Assurance
- **Build Verification**: `npm run build` completed successfully with no errors
- **Type Safety**: All components properly typed with TypeScript
- **Code Organization**: Clean import/export structure through index.ts
- **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders or state updates
