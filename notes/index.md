## How to Use This Index
- Each file contains detailed notes for a specific phase/chunk or topic.
- Refer to the appropriate file for implementation details, decisions, and progress tracking.
- Update the relevant chunk file as you work on new features or fix issues.

## Pattern for Iterating and Creating New Notes

When a new phase or chunk begins, or when a topic grows too large:
1. Create a new file named `phaseX-chunkY.md` (or `TOPIC.md` for special topics).
2. Move the relevant notes from this index or other files into the new file.
3. Add a brief summary and link to the new file in this index.
4. Keep each file focused on a single phase, chunk, or topic for clarity.

_Example:_
- When starting Phase 2, Chunk 2, create `phase2-chunk2.md` and update this index.
- For a new topic like frontend integration, create `frontend.md` and add it here.

## Endpoint Field Implementation Progress

### Task 14.4: TypeScript SDK Endpoint Support - ✅ COMPLETED

**Date**: May 24, 2025

Successfully implemented endpoint field support in the TypeScript Provider SDK:

#### Key Changes Made:

1. **Registry Types Updates** (`src/types/registry.ts`):
   - Added `endpoint: string` field to `ToolResponse` interface with JSDoc documentation
   - Added `endpoint` parameter to `register_tool` message type (required)
   - Created new `update_endpoint` message type in `RegistryExecuteMsg` union
   - Enhanced type documentation for endpoint field usage

2. **RegistryClient Enhancements** (`src/clients/RegistryClient.ts`):
   - Updated `registerTool` method signature to include `endpoint` parameter (now required before optional `denom`)
   - Implemented new `updateEndpoint` method with proper validation and error handling
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation for both methods
   - Maintained backward compatibility for optional parameters

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage** (`test/` directory):
   - Updated `registryClient.test.ts` with endpoint field in mock responses
   - Added dedicated test suites for `registerTool` with endpoint parameter
   - Created comprehensive tests for new `updateEndpoint` method functionality
   - Updated `multi-denom.test.ts` to include endpoint parameter in registerTool calls
   - Added endpoint field validation tests for all query responses

#### Technical Implementation Details:

**Method Signature Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
registerTool(senderAddress, toolId, price, description, denom?, funds?)

// After  
registerTool(senderAddress, toolId, price, description, endpoint, denom?, funds?)
```

**New Method**:
```typescript
updateEndpoint(senderAddress, toolId, endpoint, funds?)
```

#### Validation and Error Handling:
- Endpoint validation handled at contract level (max 512 characters, https:// prefix)
- Proper error propagation from contract to SDK
- Authorization checks for endpoint updates (only provider can update)

#### Test Results:
- **All 44 tests passing** across 6 test suites
- **TypeScript compilation successful** - no type errors
- **Complete test coverage** for endpoint functionality including edge cases

#### Breaking Changes:
- `registerTool` method now requires `endpoint` parameter as 5th argument
- This is a breaking change requiring client code updates
- Recommended to bump minor version when releasing

#### Next Steps:
- Proceed to section 14.5: SDK Tests Review and Updates
- Prepare for version bump and NPM publishing (14.6)
- Update frontend debug page to support endpoint functionality (14.7)
