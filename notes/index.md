## How to Use This Index
- Each file contains detailed notes for a specific phase/chunk or topic.
- Refer to the appropriate file for implementation details, decisions, and progress tracking.
- Update the relevant chunk file as you work on new features or fix issues.

## Pattern for Iterating and Creating New Notes

When a new phase or chunk begins, or when a topic grows too large:
1. Create a new file named `phaseX-chunkY.md` (or `TOPIC.md` for special topics).
2. Move the relevant notes from this index or other files into the new file.
3. Add a brief summary and link to the new file in this index.
4. Keep each file focused on a single phase, chunk, or topic for clarity.

_Example:_
- When starting Phase 2, Chunk 2, create `phase2-chunk2.md` and update this index.
- For a new topic like frontend integration, create `frontend.md` and add it here.
