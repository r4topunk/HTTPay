# Phase 1, Chunk 1: Project Setup

This file documents the implementation notes for Phase 1, Chunk 1 of the ToolPay MVP: Project Setup.

## Overview
The initial project setup has been completed successfully, establishing the foundational structure for the ToolPay MVP. This chunk focused on creating the necessary directory structure and setting up the CosmWasm contracts that will power the system.

## Key Accomplishments
- Created `contracts/` directory for CosmWasm smart contracts
- Created `packages/` directory for future TypeScript packages
- Created `frontend/` directory as a placeholder with explanatory README
- Created `scripts/` directory for helper scripts
- Generated registry and escrow contracts using CosmWasm templates
- Configured Cargo.toml at the project root with proper workspace members
- Added required dependencies: cosmwasm-std, cw-storage-plus, schemars, serde, thiserror
- Set up optimization settings for Wasm compilation
- Added rust-toolchain.toml with Rust 1.78 specification
- Verified that `cargo build` succeeds
- Added appropriate .gitignore file for Rust and Node artifacts

## Next Steps
The project is now ready for Chunk 2, which will focus on implementing the Registry contract according to the specifications in project.md.
