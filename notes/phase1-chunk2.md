# Phase 1, Chunk 2: Registry Contract Implementation

This file documents the implementation notes for Phase 1, Chunk 2 of the Pay-Per-Tool MVP: Registry Contract Implementation.

## Overview
The Registry contract has been fully implemented and tested. All required functionality for registering, updating, pausing, and querying tools has been successfully implemented and verified with a comprehensive test suite.

## Key Accomplishments
- Implemented `instantiate` function with minimal setup
- Implemented `execute` function with pattern matching for all message variants
- Created handlers for all required operations: RegisterTool, UpdatePrice, PauseTool/ResumeTool
- Implemented `query` function for retrieving tool information
- Added proper error types for contract operations
- Implemented validation checks for unauthorized access
- Added error handling for non-existent tools
- Created test helpers and mocks to simplify test cases
- Implemented tests for all major contract operations and edge cases
- Refactored tests into a separate module for better organization and maintainability

## Next Steps
The Registry contract implementation is now complete. The next phase will focus on implementing the Escrow contract (Chunk 3), beginning with defining its messages and types.
