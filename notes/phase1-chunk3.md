# Phase 1, Chunk 3: Escrow Contract Implementation

This file documents the implementation notes for Phase 1, Chunk 3 of the Pay-Per-Tool MVP: Escrow Contract Implementation.

## Overview
Work has begun on implementing the Escrow contract. We've completed defining the core message and state types and have implemented the `LockFunds` functionality, which allows users to lock funds for tool usage. Testing infrastructure has been set up and the first integration test for the complete flow is now working correctly.

## Current Progress
- Defined all required message and state types in `msg.rs` and `state.rs`
- Created `registry_interface.rs` for Registry contract interaction
- Implemented `lock_funds`, `release`, and `refund_expired` handlers with all required validations and error handling
- Added event emissions for all major operations
- Implemented sudo freeze functionality
- Set up integration tests and fixed address handling issues
- Documented all key design decisions and error handling patterns

## Next Steps
With the core contract functionality now fully implemented, the next phase will focus on implementing comprehensive unit tests for the contracts (Chunk 4).
