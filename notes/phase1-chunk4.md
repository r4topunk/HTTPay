# Phase 1, Chunk 4: Contract Unit Tests

This file documents the implementation notes for Phase 1, Chunk 4 of the HTTPay MVP: Contract Unit Tests.

## Overview
Comprehensive unit tests for both the Registry and Escrow contracts have been implemented and are now passing successfully. A robust testing environment with cw-multi-test has been established that allows for proper integration testing between contracts.

## Current Progress
- Set up a well-organized test directory structure for the Escrow contract
- Configured cw-multi-test framework for integration testing
- Created mock accounts and helper functions for all major contract operations
- Implemented comprehensive end-to-end integration tests for all contract flows
- Added edge case tests for TTL, excessive fees, authorization, refunds, and contract freezing
- Fixed all test execution issues, including address formatting and error handling
- Standardized error handling patterns in tests
- All 11 tests are now passing successfully, covering all major and edge case scenarios

## Next Steps
The test implementation is complete with all tests passing. The only remaining task is to check code coverage (if available). Once this is done, we can move on to Chunk 5: CI & Localnet Configuration.
