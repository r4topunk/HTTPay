# Phase 2, Chunk 1: Provider SDK Project Setup

This file documents the implementation notes for Phase 2, Chunk 1 of the ToolPay MVP: Provider SDK Project Setup.

## Overview
The Provider SDK project setup has been completed successfully, establishing the foundational structure for the TypeScript SDK. This setup focused on creating the necessary directory structure, configuring TypeScript, and setting up development tools.

## Key Accomplishments
- Created `packages/provider-sdk` directory for the TypeScript SDK
- Set up source code directories (`src/`, `src/bindings/`, `src/types/`, `src/utils/`)
- Created placeholder `index.ts` as the main entry point
- Initialized with `pnpm init` and configured package.json
- Added proper package metadata, scripts, and export declarations
- Set up npm publication configuration with appropriate fields
- Configured TypeScript with strict settings targeting Node 20+ and ES2022 modules
- Added Jest for testing with appropriate configuration
- Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality enforcement
- Added build scripts, test scripts, and linting configurations
- Created a comprehensive README.md with project overview, usage examples, and API documentation placeholder
- Added JSDoc comments to exported functionality

## Next Steps
The SDK project setup is now complete. The next phase will focus on implementing Contract Bindings and Types by generating TypeScript interfaces from contract schemas.
