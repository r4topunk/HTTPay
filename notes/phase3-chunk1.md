# Phase 3, Chunk 1: Core SDK Classes Implementation

This file documents the implementation notes for Phase 3, Chunk 1 of the HTTPay MVP: Core SDK Classes Implementation.

## Overview
The Core SDK Classes implementation has been completed successfully, providing the essential functionality needed for tool providers to interact with the HTTPay smart contracts. This phase focused on implementing the main verification and reporting logic needed by tool providers.

## Key Accomplishments

### EscrowVerifier Implementation
- Created `EscrowVerifier` class that handles validation of escrows
- Implemented comprehensive verification logic that checks:
  - Escrow existence
  - Provider address matching
  - Authentication token validity
  - Escrow expiration status
- Added detailed error messages for all failure cases
- Created well-defined TypeScript interfaces for verification parameters and results

### UsageReporter Implementation
- Created `UsageReporter` class for posting tool usage and claiming escrow funds
- Implemented `postUsage` method with full error handling and validation
- Added support for transaction parameters (gas, memo, timeout)
- Created well-defined TypeScript interfaces for reporting parameters and results
- Built in safety checks to prevent claiming more than the maximum fee

### HTTPaySDK Main Class Implementation
- Created `HTTPaySDK` class as the main entry point for the SDK
- Implemented configuration options for network, contracts, and gas settings
- Added connection methods for:
  - Read-only queries (`connect()`)
  - Signing with mnemonic (`connectWithMnemonic()`)
  - Using an existing signing client (`connectWithSigningClient()`)
- Added unified access to all SDK components:
  - `registry` - Registry contract client
  - `escrow` - Escrow contract client
  - `escrowVerifier` - Escrow verification functionality
  - `usageReporter` - Usage reporting and fund claiming
- Added convenience methods that proxy to the underlying components
- Added proper error handling and initialization checks

## Updated Exports
- Updated `index.ts` to export all new classes and types
- Added proper JSDoc documentation for better IDE support

## Dependencies
- Added `@cosmjs/proto-signing` dependency for wallet functionality

## Next Steps
The core SDK implementation is now complete. The next phase will focus on implementing the utilities and configuration components, including more advanced wallet integration and error handling.
