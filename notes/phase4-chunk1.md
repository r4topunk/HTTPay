# Phase 4, Chunk 1: Utilities and Configuration Implementation

This file documents the implementation notes for Phase 4, Chunk 1 of the Pay-Per-Tool Provider SDK: Utilities and Configuration.

## Overview

Phase 4 focused on enhancing the Provider SDK with robust configuration handling, wallet management utilities, and standardized error handling. These improvements make the SDK more developer-friendly and resilient to edge cases while providing clear, actionable error messages when things go wrong.

## Key Accomplishments

### Configuration Validation

- Created a comprehensive configuration validation system in `utils/config.ts`:
  - Implemented `validateConfig` function to verify all required SDK configuration fields
  - Added validations for RPC endpoints (URL format), chain ID, and contract addresses
  - Added Neutron address format validation for registry and escrow contract addresses
  - Added gas adjustment validation to ensure positive values
  - Implemented network defaults for mainnet, testnet, and local development environments

### Wallet Integration

- Implemented wallet management utilities in `utils/wallet.ts`:
  - Created `createWalletFromMnemonic` function with flexible options (prefix, language, HD path)
  - Implemented `createSigningClientFromWallet` to abstract away CosmJS client creation complexity
  - Added `getWalletAddress` helper to extract address from wallet objects
  - Added `isValidAddress` function to verify Bech32 address format with prefix checking
  - Added TypeScript safeguards to prevent undefined access errors

### Error Handling

- Designed a comprehensive error class hierarchy in `utils/errors.ts`:
  - Created base `Pay-Per-ToolError` class with code and details support
  - Implemented specific error subclasses:
    - `ConfigurationError` for SDK configuration issues
    - `NetworkError` for RPC connection problems
    - `ContractError` for contract execution failures
    - `EscrowVerificationError` for escrow validation issues
    - `UsageReportingError` for usage reporting failures
    - `WalletError` for wallet-related problems
  - Added `normalizeError` utility function to standardize error handling throughout the SDK
  - Ensured error objects contain rich context data to help diagnose issues

## Integration with Pay-Per-ToolSDK

Modified the main Pay-Per-ToolSDK class to use these new utilities:
- Applied configuration validation in the constructor
- Used wallet utilities for mnemonic handling
- Implemented error normalization across all public methods
- Added typed error handling with appropriate error subclasses

## Challenges and Solutions

- **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed several TypeScript compilation errors related to error handling and type narrowing:
  - Removed all usages of the `any` type in SDK source files for improved type safety
  - Used type guards and type assertions with `unknown` instead of `any` in error handling
  - Fixed null checks for arrays and potential undefined values
  - Added workaround for accessing the signer (which is private in SigningCosmWasmClient)

- **ClientOptions Type Safety**: Addressed type errors with SigningCosmWasmClientOptions:
  - Fixed the gasPrice handling to match CosmJS requirements
  - Removed invalid options (prefix) from client creation

- **Error Normalization**: Ensured all errors thrown from SDK methods are properly normalized:
  - Added safe error message extraction with fallbacks for different error types
  - Preserved original errors in the details property for debugging

## Next Steps

With Phase 4 complete, the SDK now has a solid foundation for configuration, wallet management, and error handling. The next phase (Phase 5) will focus on:

1. Adding comprehensive JSDoc/TSDoc comments to all public classes and methods
2. Implementing unit and integration tests with Jest
3. Creating an AI-Wallet demo client and adding E2E tests

These improvements will ensure the SDK is well-documented, thoroughly tested, and provides usage examples for consumers.
