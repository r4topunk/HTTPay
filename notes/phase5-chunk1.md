# Phase 5: Documentation and Testing

## Overview
This phase focused on enhancing the Provider SDK with comprehensive documentation, testing, and a demonstration script for the AI-Wallet workflow. The goal was to ensure the SDK is well-documented, thoroughly tested, and includes concrete examples of how to use it in real-world scenarios.

## Completed Tasks

### Documentation
- Added JSDoc/TSDoc comments to all public classes and methods in the SDK, including:
  - `ToolPaySDK` - Main entry point with comprehensive documentation
  - `EscrowVerifier` - Documentation with usage examples and parameter descriptions
  - `UsageReporter` - Documentation with detailed interface explanations
  - Various utility modules and client wrappers
- Documentation follows best practices with:
  - Class/method purpose explanations
  - Parameter descriptions
  - Return value documentation
  - Usage examples with code snippets
  - Error handling documentation

### Unit and Integration Tests
- Implemented test suite using Jest
- Created mock implementations for contract clients and blockchain interactions
- Developed comprehensive tests for key components:
  - `toolPaySDK.test.ts` - Testing the main SDK class
  - `usageReporter.test.ts` - Testing usage reporting functionality
- Tests cover various scenarios:
  - SDK initialization with different configurations
  - Client connections (read-only and signing)
  - Escrow verification with various edge cases
  - Usage reporting and fund claiming
  - Error handling and validation

### AI-Wallet Client Demo
- Implemented `aiWalletDemo.ts` script demonstrating the full ToolPay workflow:
  1. Provider registration
  2. Tool discovery by client
  3. Fund locking in escrow
  4. Escrow verification
  5. Service delivery (simulated)
  6. Usage reporting and fund claiming
- Demo script includes:
  - Configuration handling
  - Wallet setup for both provider and client
  - Error handling and explanatory logging
  - Complete end-to-end flow example

### Recent Improvements
- Enhanced error handling in the demo script
- Simplified result handling in UsageReporter to improve code clarity
- Fixed client retrieval issues in the demo script
- Improved escrow verification to handle edge cases

## Next Steps
- Prepare for NPM publication (Phase 6)
- Configure package.json with proper metadata and exports
- Define the files to be included in the package
- Set up versioning and potential CI/CD pipelines

## Summary
Phase 5 successfully transformed the Provider SDK from a functional implementation to a production-ready package with comprehensive documentation, testing, and example code. The SDK now follows best practices for TypeScript libraries and provides a clear, well-documented API for tool providers to interact with ToolPay contracts.
