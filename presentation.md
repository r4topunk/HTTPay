# HTTPay – API Marketplace with Autonomous Payments

## Openning

Gm, I'm r4to and I'm here to present you the HTTPay, a decentralized API marketplace for AI agents, with automatic payments via blockchain.


## Main Topics

- Marketplace where developers monetize APIs for AI agents
- Autonomous payments via smart contracts
- New revenue source for developers and API creators
- Infrastructure for automated API economy

### Presenter Notes

HTTPay allows developers to monetize their APIs through autonomous payments from AI agents. The project explores a new emerging economy where APIs are discovered, contracted, and paid for automatically, without human intervention in the service contracting process. I will show how this creates value for both developers and consumers.

# 1 Problem & Opportunity

## Main Topics

- Developers have valuable APIs but difficulty monetizing for AIs
- AI agents need to discover and pay for services automatically
- Lack of marketplace focused on autonomous consumers
- Opportunity to create new API economy

### Presenter Notes

Developers create powerful APIs but monetizing them for AI agents is complex. Autonomous agents needs humans to discover and contract APIs, and there's no marketplace focused on them. Current methods require manual integrations and human pre-approved payments. The opportunity: create a marketplace where developers list APIs and agents discover and pay for their use, unlocking a new revenue source thought microtransactions and complete automation.

# 2 Solution – What is HTTPay?

## Main Topics

- Decentralized API marketplace for AI agents
- Companies register and price their APIs in the Registry
- Agents discover, contract, and pay automatically
- Smart contracts ensure secure payments

### Presenter Notes

HTTPay is a decentralized marketplace where developers publish their APIs and AI agents consume them autonomously. It works in two stages: first, developers register their APIs in the Registry Contract with prices per call. Second, agents discover these APIs, lock funds in the Escrow Contract and are automatically charged after the API response is sent. Built with CosmWasm, we ensure transparency and security. Seeking mass adoption, we offer also offer a Typescript SDK for developers to easily integrate their agents into the marketplace.

# 3 Value Proposition & Strategic Impact

## Main Topics

- New revenue source for developers and API creators
- Automated monetization without manual billing management
- Global API market estimated at $50 billion by 2030
- First marketplace focused on autonomous consumers

### Presenter Notes

For developers: HTTPay creates a new automated revenue source. APIs that previously had few clients can now be monetized by thousands of autonomous agents running 24/7, without manual billing management or complex integrations. For agents: instant access to specialized services without relying on humans for configuration. The global API marketplace market size was estimated at USD 18.00 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 18.9% from 2025 to 2030. We are the first marketplace designed specifically for autonomous consumers, positioning Cosmos at the forefront of this convergence between AI and Blockchain.

# 4 Trends – Convergence of AI + Web3

## Main Topics

- Rise of Generative AI and autonomous agents
- Web3 offers decentralized trust
- Growth in the AI-blockchain market
- HTTPay: autonomous decision + secure financial execution

### Presenter Notes

The timing is perfect: we're seeing an explosion of generative AI and autonomous agents, while Web3 offers programmable digital assets. Major companies like Coinbase Ventures are already investing heavily in this intersection. HTTPay leverages the best of both worlds: autonomous AI decision-making + secure blockchain financial execution.

# 5 Technology & Cosmos Integration

## Main Topics

- Cosmos + CosmWasm: flexibility and agility
- IBC: payments between diverse networks
- High scalability and low fees
- Security via decentralized network

### Presenter Notes

CosmWasm gives me the flexibility to program complex logic quickly. IBC allows agents on different networks to use the protocol, expanding the marketplace's reach. Cosmos provides scalability and low fees for frequent microtransactions, which is perfect for fast agent interactions, with the security of a decentralized network.

# 6 Use Case – Autonomous Agent in Action

## Main Topics

- Agent discovers financial data API in the marketplace
- Locks funds in escrow and receives authentication token
- Consumes API and provider automatically verifies payment
- Complete marketplace process without human intervention

### Presenter Notes

An AI agent needs financial data for analysis. It queries the HTTPay Registry, finds a real-time data API created by an independent developer for 1 Neutron per call.

The agent locks funds in escrow and uses the authentication token to call the API.

The developer API verifies the escrow, delivers the data, and claims the payment.

The entire marketplace-discovery-payment-delivery cycle happens without humans.

# 7 Competitive Differentiator

## Main Topics

- Existing marketplaces focus on humans, not agents
- Enterprise APIs require contracts and manual integrations
- First native marketplace for autonomous consumers
- Smart contracts eliminate intermediaries and manual billing

### Presenter Notes

Marketplaces like RapidAPI focus on human developers with dashboards and manual billing. Traditional APIs require API keys, custom integrations, and complex payment management. No solution was designed for thousands of autonomous agents dynamically finding and consuming APIs. HTTPay is the first API marketplace for autonomous consumers in the Cosmos ecosystem: programmatic discovery, instant payments, and automatic settlement via smart contracts.

# 8 Future Vision – Infrastructure for the Agent Economy

## Main Topics

- First API marketplace in the Cosmos ecosystem
- Scale to millions of agents on multiple networks
- Foundation for a machine-to-machine economy
- Decentralized identity and reputation
- Standardization and broad adoption of the protocol

### Presenter Notes

As the first API marketplace in the Cosmos ecosystem, I aim for HTTPay to become fundamental infrastructure for the autonomous agent economy. The architecture was designed to support millions of agents transacting across multiple interconnected networks. I plan to integrate a reputation system to provide more security for payment and service contracting within the marketplace. And of course, develop libraries focused on the most popular AI frameworks like Eliza and LangChain.

# 9 Conclusion & Next Steps

## Main Topics

- Innovative union: AI + Web3 in a functional solution
- Complete MVP with operational contracts
- Post-hackathon evolutions: scale, security, and partnerships
- Leadership opportunity in Cosmos

### Presenter Notes

HTTPay connects developers and AI agents in a functional marketplace and is the first API marketplace in the Cosmos ecosystem. I developed an operational MVP: Registry for publishing APIs, Escrow for secure payments, and Typescript SDK for easy integration. Developers can already monetize APIs and agents can already consume them autonomously. A great opportunity for Cosmos to lead the autonomous API economy. 

Thank you!
