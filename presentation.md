# HTTPay – Autonomous Payments for the AI + Web3 Era

## Main Topics

- Integration of AI and blockchain for automated markets
- Empowers AI agents for autonomous transactions
- Infrastructure for the new agent economy

### Presenter Notes

Gm, judges. I present HTTPay, a protocol that unites Artificial Intelligence and Web3 to allow autonomous agents to make payments securely and automatically. My project arises to accompany the convergence between AI and blockchain – two fundamental technological trends – creating essential infrastructure for a future economy of autonomous agents (machines negotiating with machines). In short, HTTPay empowers AI agents to pay and receive from each other without human intervention, reliably. I will show how this brings market value and strategic impact, supported by Cosmos technology.

# 1 - Problem & Opportunity

## Main Topics

- AI agents need to access paid services and data
- Lack of reliable means for autonomous transactions
- Traditional payments hinder full automation
- Technical barrier to AI autonomy

### Presenter Notes

What problem do I want to solve? With the rise of increasingly capable AI agents (think frameworks like ElizaOS and OnChainKit), we encounter a practical limitation: these agents cannot pay for resources or services on their own. If an AI needs to access a paid API, hire an online service, or remunerate another AI, it depends on a human to intervene and make the payment. This creates friction, delays, and costs – exactly the opposite of the efficiency expected from automation. Current payment methods (credit cards, centralized gateways) were simply not designed for real-time autonomous decisions. Thus, there is a great opportunity: developing a protocol to fill this gap – enabling secure autonomous payments – will unlock a new level of automated and efficient services that run day and night without human supervision.

# 2 - Solution – What is HTTPay?

## Main Topics

- Payment protocol for AI agents
- Autonomous transactions without human intervention
- Smart contracts ensure trust and automatic rules
- API for integration with AIs

### Presenter Notes

Meet my solution: HTTPay is a payment protocol for API services focused on autonomous agents. In practice, HTTPay works as the "digital wallet and payment orchestrator" for an agent. With it, an AI agent can use a crypto wallet to interact with internet services. For example, an AI can remunerate another for a service rendered or pay for access to a market data API, all without needing a human to authorize. I built these rules using CosmWasm Smart Contracts on the Cosmos blockchain – which ensures that each transaction obeys programmed conditions and is transparent and secure. And to facilitate adoption, I offer simple integration via a Typescript SDK: developers can connect their agents to HTTPay with a few lines of code, enabling autonomous payments quickly.

# 3 - Value Proposition & Strategic Impact

## Main Topics

- Enables 24/7 automated services
- Reduces costs in frequent microtransactions
- Positions Cosmos at the forefront of AI + Web3
- Expanding market: union of billion-dollar industries

### Presenter Notes

What is the value that HTTPay delivers and why is this strategically important? First, the protocol unlocks a new generation of automated services. Imagine ecosystems where agents can hire other agents, or have access to updated data, 24 hours a day – this becomes viable when we eliminate the barrier of manual payment. Strategically, by uniting AI and blockchain, I position the Cosmos ecosystem at the forefront of this high-tech union. This attracts new developers and users to Cosmos, presenting an innovative use case aligned with the biggest trends of the moment. Finally, the market potential here is enormous: we are at the intersection of two billion-dollar industries in exponential growth. In other words, the impact of developing the HTTPay protocol can be global, serving as infrastructure for an emerging and highly valuable market.

# 4 - Trends – Convergence of AI + Web3

## Main Topics

- Rise of Generative AI and autonomous agents
- Web3 offers decentralized trust
- Growth in the AI-blockchain market
- HTTPay: autonomous decision + secure financial execution

### Presenter Notes

It is worth highlighting the timing of my solution in relation to trends. We are experiencing two simultaneous technological revolutions: on one hand, the explosion of generative AI and autonomous agents capable of executing complex tasks (we see initiatives like the Eliza framework and OnChainKit evolving rapidly); on the other, the advancement of Web3 and blockchains, which offer an environment without central trust and with programmable digital assets. It is natural for these two worlds to begin to converge – and, in fact, we already see large companies and startups investing heavily in this intersection between AI and blockchain. HTTPay is born precisely in this context: the protocol seeks to leverage the best of both universes, uniting the autonomous decision-making capacity that AI brings with the secure financial execution capacity that blockchain provides. I am positioned at the crest of this wave of convergence, which increases the chances of adoption and relevance of the solution.

# 5 - Technology & Cosmos Integration

## Main Topics

- Cosmos + CosmWasm: flexibility and agility
- IBC: payments between diverse networks
- High scalability and low fees
- Security via decentralized network

### Presenter Notes

I developed my solution directly on the Cosmos platform, leveraging CosmWasm to write the smart contracts that manage agent payments. CosmWasm gives me the flexibility to program complex logic quickly and securely, ideal in the hackathon context and beyond. Another key advantage of Cosmos is IBC – Inter-Blockchain Communication: with it, HTTPay is not restricted to a single chain, and can transfer value between multiple blockchains in the ecosystem. This means an agent on one network can pay another agent on another network transparently, greatly expanding the solution's reach. Technically, Cosmos also provides the scalability and low fees necessary to support a large volume of microtransactions (which is the case for agents frequently exchanging value). And all this comes with the robustness of a decentralized network of multiple validator nodes, ensuring the security and reliability that an autonomous payment infrastructure demands.

# 6 - Use Case – Autonomous Agent in Action

## Main Topics

- AI buys external data via autonomous payment
- Smart contract ensures release after delivery
- Entire process without human intervention
- Fast, reliable, and traceable transaction

### Presenter Notes

To make everything more concrete, let's look at a use case. Imagine a virtual sales assistant, an autonomous AI, that has identified a potential client and wants to impress them with a personalized market analysis. For this, this AI needs updated financial data from an external source that charges for access. Instead of triggering a person to approve the purchase of this data, the AI agent itself makes the payment using HTTPay. The HTTPay smart contract comes into play: it holds the value in escrow and only releases the payment to the API after the data is delivered back to the agent. Everything is recorded on the blockchain for transparency. In the end, the task was completed without any human intervention – the agent managed to buy the necessary information autonomously, quickly, and reliably.

# 7 - Competitive Differentiator

## Main Topics

- Alternatives depend on centralized intermediaries
- Generic blockchains do not optimize automatic microtransactions
- Specific design for AI agents

### Presenter Notes

How do I position myself in relation to possible existing solutions? Today, even the few attempts to enable payments for AIs end up depending on intermediaries. For example, using a centralized payment provider or storing a credit card in a service – this requires trust in third parties and removes the agent's autonomy. On the other hand, current generic blockchain platforms were not designed with AI agents in mind: they do not handle thousands of automated microtransactions well, nor do they provide easy triggers for an AI to initiate payments on its own. HTTPay differentiates itself precisely because of this focus. From the beginning, I conceived the protocol oriented to the needs of autonomous agents: end-to-end automation (from trigger to settlement), native integration with AI systems, and optimization for frequent and small transactions.

# 8 - Future Vision – Infrastructure for the Agent Economy

## Main Topics

- Scale to millions of agents on multiple networks
- Foundation for a machine-to-machine economy
- Decentralized identity and reputation
- Standardization and broad adoption of the protocol

### Presenter Notes

Looking ahead, I see HTTPay evolving to become a fundamental infrastructure in the emerging autonomous agent economy. The architecture was born with scalability in mind – I want to support, in the future, millions of agents transacting simultaneously across multiple interconnected blockchain networks. I envision HTTPay as a central pillar of a machine-to-machine economy, in which automated agents negotiate services, close contracts, and make payments to each other without any human intervention. To get there, I plan to integrate features like decentralized identity and agent reputation systems, allowing each agent to have reliable on-chain credentials. I also see the importance of standardizing the protocol and collaborating with the community – I want HTTPay to be widely adopted by AI projects and even in DeFi applications involving automation. In short, my vision is for the protocol to become the backbone of the autonomous economy, where not only people, but machines and intelligent agents, participate actively and securely.

# 9 - Conclusion & Next Steps

## Main Topics

- Innovative union: AI + Web3 in a functional solution
- Complete MVP with operational contracts
- Post-hackathon evolutions: scale, security, and partnerships
- Leadership opportunity in Cosmos

### Presenter Notes

To conclude, HTTPay shows how it is possible to connect two of the biggest technological trends of the moment – AI and Web3 – in a practical, innovative, and functional solution. During the hackathon, I managed to develop a fully operational MVP using CosmWasm contracts, proving the technical feasibility of the idea (i.e., AI agents can already make payments in my prototype). And this is just the beginning: I am ready to take HTTPay beyond the hackathon prototype. I have some ideas for next steps, including technical improvements in scale and security, and I am seeking strategic partnerships in the ecosystem (both in the Cosmos community and with AI projects) to accelerate adoption. I see a great opportunity here for the Cosmos ecosystem to lead innovation in the autonomous agent economy, and I am motivated and prepared to drive this vision forward. Thank you all for your attention – thank you very much!
