### Presenter Notes

> “What problem do I want to solve? With the rise of increasingly capable AI agents (think GPT-based assistants like AutoGPT), we encounter a practical limitation: these agents cannot pay for resources or services on their own. If an AI needs to access a paid API, hire an online service, or remunerate another AI, it depends on a human to intervene and make the payment. This creates friction, delays, and costs – exactly the opposite of the efficiency expected from automation. Current payment methods (credit cards, centralized gateways) were simply not designed for real-time autonomous decisions. Thus, there is a great opportunity: the organization or platform that solves this gap – enabling secure autonomous payments – will unlock a new level of automated and efficient services.”

### Presenter Notes

> “Meet my solution: ToolPay is a decentralized payment platform tailor-made for autonomous agents. In practice, ToolPay functions as the “digital wallet and payment orchestrator” for an AI. With it, an AI agent can send and receive payments automatically, following predefined rules in smart contracts. For example, an AI can remunerate another for a service rendered or pay for access to an API, all without needing a human to authorize it. I built these rules using CosmWasm Smart Contracts on the Cosmos blockchain – which ensures that each transaction obeys programmed conditions and is transparent and secure. And to facilitate adoption, I offer simple integration via API: developers can connect their agents to ToolPay with a few lines of code, enabling autonomous payments quickly.”

### Presenter Notes

> “It's worth highlighting the timing of my solution in relation to trends. We are experiencing two simultaneous technological revolutions: on one hand, the explosion of generative AI and autonomous agents capable of executing complex tasks (we see examples like ChatGPT and initiatives like AutoGPT evolving rapidly); on the other, the advancement of Web3 and blockchains, which offer an environment without central trust and with programmable digital assets. It is natural for these two worlds to begin to converge – and indeed, we already see large companies and startups investing heavily in this intersection between AI and blockchain. ToolPay is born precisely in this context: my platform leverages the best of both universes, joining the autonomous decision-making capacity that AI brings with the secure financial execution capacity that blockchain provides. I am positioned at the crest of this wave of convergence, which increases the chances of adoption and relevance of my solution.”

### Presenter Notes

> “Let's talk about the technology behind ToolPay and why I chose Cosmos. I developed my solution directly on the Cosmos platform, leveraging CosmWasm to write the smart contracts that manage agent payments. CosmWasm gives me the flexibility to program complex logic quickly and securely, ideal in the hackathon context and beyond. Another key advantage of Cosmos is IBC – Inter-Blockchain Communication: with it, ToolPay is not restricted to a single chain, and can transfer value between multiple blockchains in the ecosystem. This means an agent on one network can pay another agent on another network transparently, greatly expanding the solution's reach. Technically, Cosmos also provides the scalability and low fees necessary to support a large volume of microtransactions (which is the case for agents frequently exchanging value). And all this comes with the robustness of a decentralized network of multiple validator nodes, ensuring the security and reliability that an autonomous payment infrastructure demands.”

## Key Topics

- AI buys external data via autonomous payment
- Smart contract ensures release after delivery
- Entire process without human intervention
- Fast, reliable, and traceable transaction

### Presenter Notes

> “To make everything more concrete, let's look at a use case. Imagine a virtual sales assistant, an autonomous AI, that has identified a potential client and wants to impress them with a personalized market analysis. For this, this AI needs updated financial data from an external source that charges for access. Instead of triggering a person to approve the purchase of this data, the AI agent itself makes the payment using ToolPay. The ToolPay smart contract comes into play: it holds the value in escrow and only releases the payment to the API after the data is delivered back to the agent. Everything is recorded on the blockchain for transparency. In the end, the task was completed without any human intervention – the agent managed to buy the necessary information autonomously, quickly, and reliably, thanks to ToolPay.”

# Competitive Differentiator

---

## Key Topics

- Alternatives depend on centralized intermediaries
- Generic blockchains do not optimize automatic microtransactions
- Specific design for AI agents
- Unique in Cosmos with multi-chain reach via IBC

### Presenter Notes

> “How do I position myself in relation to possible existing solutions? Today, even the few attempts to enable payments for AIs end up depending on intermediaries. For example, using a centralized payment provider or storing a credit card in a service – this requires trust in third parties and removes the agent's autonomy. On the other hand, current generic blockchain platforms were not designed with AI agents in mind: they do not handle thousands of automated microtransactions well, nor do they provide easy triggers for an AI to initiate payments on its own. ToolPay differentiates itself precisely because of this focus. From the beginning, I conceived the platform oriented to the needs of autonomous agents: end-to-end automation (from trigger to settlement), native integration with AI systems, and optimization for frequent and small transactions. Furthermore, in the Cosmos ecosystem, there is nothing like it – I am a pioneer in this proposal here. While other solutions may be limited to a single network or token, with ToolPay, thanks to IBC, we operate multi-chain, giving agents maximum flexibility on where and how to transact. In summary, I offer true autonomy, technical optimization, and expanded reach – a set of differentiators difficult to match.”

### Presenter Notes

> “Looking ahead, I see ToolPay evolving to become a fundamental infrastructure in the emerging autonomous agent economy. My architecture was born with scalability in mind – I want to support, in the future, millions of agents transacting simultaneously across multiple interconnected blockchain networks. I envision ToolPay as a central pillar of a machine-to-machine economy, in which automated agents negotiate services, close contracts, and make payments to each other without any human intervention. To get there, I plan to integrate features like decentralized identity and agent reputation systems, allowing each agent to have reliable on-chain credentials. I also see the importance of standardizing my protocol and collaborating with the community – I want ToolPay to be widely adopted by AI, IoT projects, and even in DeFi applications involving automation. In short, my vision is for ToolPay to become the backbone of the autonomous economy, where not only people, but machines and intelligent agents, participate actively and securely.”
