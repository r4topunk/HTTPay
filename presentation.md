# HTTPay

Gm, I'm r4to and I'm here to present you HTTPay, a decentralized API marketplace for AI agents, with automatic payments via blockchain. The project is open-source and available on Github under the MIT license. It has more than 200 commits over the hackathon period.

# Autonomous Payments for the AI + Web3 Era

HTTPay allows developers to monetize their APIs through on-chain microtransactions.

The project explores a new emerging economy where APIs are discovered, requested and paid for
automatically, without human intervention through account creation and billing configuration.

I will show how this creates value for both developers and consumers.

# 1 Problem & Opportunity

Developers create powerful APIs but monetizing them is kinda complex.

Autonomous agents need humans to discover and sign for APIs, and there's no marketplace focused on them.

Current methods require manual integrations with API keys and human pre-configured payments with credit cards.

The opportunity: create a marketplace where developers list APIs and agents discover and pay for their use, unlocking a new revenue source thought microtransactions and complete automation.

---


# 2 Solution – What is HTTPay?

HTTPay is a decentralized marketplace where developers publish their APIs and AI agents consume them autonomously.

It works in two stages: first, developers register their APIs in the Registry Contract with prices per call.

Second, agents discover these APIs, lock funds in the Escrow Contract and are automatically charged after the API response is sent.

Built with CosmWasm, we ensure transparency and security.

Seeking mass adoption, we offer also offer a Typescript SDK for developers to easily integrate their agents into the marketplace.

# 3 Value Proposition & Strategic Impact

For both web2 and web3 developers: HTTPay creates a new automated revenue source.

APIs that previously had just a few user, can now be monetized by thousands of autonomous agents running 24/7, without manual billing management or complex integrations.

For agents: instant access to specialized services without relying on humans for configuration.

The global API marketplace market size was estimated at USD 18.00 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 18.9% from 2025 to 2030.

We are the first marketplace designed specifically for autonomous consumers, positioning Cosmos at the forefront of this convergence between AI and Blockchain.

# 4 Trends – Convergence of AI + Web3

The timing is perfect: we're seeing an explosion of generative AI and autonomous agents, while Web3 offers programmable digital assets.

Major companies like Coinbase Ventures are already investing heavily in this intersection.

HTTPay leverages the best of both worlds: autonomous AI decision-making + secure blockchain financial execution.

# 5 Technology & Cosmos Integration

CosmWasm gives me the flexibility to program complex logic quickly.

IBC allows agents on different networks to use the protocol, expanding the marketplace's reach.

Cosmos provides scalability and low fees for frequent microtransactions, which is perfect for fast agent interactions, with the security of a decentralized network.

# 6 Use Case – Autonomous Agent in Action

An AI agent needs financial data for analysis.

It queries the HTTPay Registry, finds a real-time data API created by an independent developer for 1 Atom per call.

The agent locks funds in escrow and uses the authentication token to call the API.

The developer API verifies the escrow, delivers the data, and claims the payment.

The entire marketplace-discovery-payment-delivery cycle happens without humans.

---

# 7 Competitive Differentiator

Marketplaces like RapidAPI focus on human developers with dashboards and manual billing.

Traditional APIs require API keys, custom integrations, and complex payment management.

No solution was designed for thousands of autonomous agents dynamically finding and consuming APIs.

HTTPay is the first API marketplace for autonomous consumers in the Cosmos ecosystem: programmatic discovery, instant payments, and automatic settlement via smart contracts.

---


# 8 Future Vision – Infrastructure for the Agentic Economy

HTTPay was designed to become fundamental infrastructure for the autonomous agent economy.

The architecture was designed to support millions of agents transacting across multiple interconnected networks.

I plan to integrate a reputation system to provide more security for payment and service contracting within the marketplace, and also a requirement for staking Atom in order to registry a new API.

And of course, develop libraries focused on the most popular AI frameworks like Eliza and LangChain.

---


# 9 Conclusion & Next Steps

HTTPay connects developers and AI agents in a functional marketplace and is the first API marketplace in the Cosmos ecosystem.

HTTPay is an operational MVP: Registry for publishing APIs, Escrow for secure payments, a Typescript SDK for easy integration and a website for developers to find the marketplace, understand the project and publish their APIs.

Developers can already monetize APIs and agents can already consume them autonomously.

It's great opportunity for Cosmos to lead the autonomous API economy.


Thank you!
